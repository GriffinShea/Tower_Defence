Description:	This was submitted as a final project for COMP2501 - Computer Game
		Design and Development, in April 2019. Houssam Rahal and I worked
		together to design and build a tower defence style game using C++
		and OpenGL (GLEW library) over a four month period. Most game assets
		were taked from public domain sources, but level backgrounds and the
		title screen were created by Houssam. Majority of the code was
		written by myself, but not all.

Instructions:
		1. Download the whole Tower_Defence folder and do not seperate the
		   contents.
		2. TowerDefenceProject_COMP2501//TowerDefenceProject_COMP2501.sln is
		   the Visual Studio Solution file, open it in Visual Studio 2017 or
		   compatable version.
		3. Click the green start arrow at the top to start the game.
		4. Select a level using the '1', '2', or '3' key.
		5. Click in an empty space while holding 'I' for an ice tower, 'F' for
		   a fire tower, or 'L' for a lightning tower. You must have enough
		   currency for the price of the tower. When enemies are killed by the
		   towers, currency is gained and there is a chance for them to drop a
		   wizard pickup. You can pick up the pickups by clicking them. Once
		   you have collected three of them, you can press 'W' to spawn the
		   wizard who will freeze enemies. If 10 enemies reach your gate you
		   will lose the game.
